# BLG-351E
A class repository for BLG 351E Microcomputer Laboratory.

In this laboratory lecture, there are eight experiments, we are asked to implement several programs using assembly language for Texas Insturments MSP430G2553 microcontroller in each experiment.

Several assembly code are in asm format, several of them are in txt format.

| Number | Experiment Name | Description |
| :----: | :-------------- | :---------- |
| 1 | Basic Assembly Coding                      | We are asked to light several LEDs in a pattern using GPIO ports. |
| 2 | General Purpose Input Output               | We are asked to change lighting LED with a push of a button and a counter for how many times that button is pressed. |
| 3 | Advanced Assembly Coding                   | We are asked to implement a subroutine for modulo operation using Russian Peasant Division and to implement a hashmap using that subroutine. |
| 4 | Stack and Subrotouine                      | We are asked to implement several subroutines and functions using the stack and to merge them to create a complex program. |
| 5 | 7-Segment Display and Interrupt Subroutine | We are asked to implement even-counter and odd-counter using 7-segment display and for our program to be able to change counting mode when a button is pressed using interrupt subroutines. |
| 6 | Playing with Time                          | We are asked to implement a timer with start-stop and save best time features using interrupt subroutines and 7-segment display. |
| 7 | LCD Display                                | We are asked to write sliding text into 16x2 LCD text display. |
| 8 | Random Number Generation                   | We are asked to implement several random number generator functions and to display numbers on LCD and save them in RAM. |
