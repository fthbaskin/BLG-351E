# BLG-351E
A class repository for BLG 351E Microcomputer Laboratory.

In this laboratory lecture, there are eight experiments, we are asked to implement several programs using assembly language for Texas Insturments MSP430G2553 microcontroller in each experiment.

Several assembly code are in asm format, several of them are in txt format.

| Number | Experiment Name | Description |
| :----: | :-------------- | :---------- |
| 1 | Basic Assembly Coding        | We are asked to light several LEDs in a pattern using GPIO ports. |
| 2 | General Purpose Input Output | We are asked to change lighting LED with a push of a button and a counter for how many times that button is pressed. |
| 3 | Advanced Assembly Coding     | We are asked to implement a subroutine for modulo operation using Russian Peasant Division and to implement a hashmap using that subroutine. |
